 		<p>
 			I grew up in Orlando, Florida. 
 			This means that I'm usually cold from October to May, but never feel like it's too humid. 
 			I moved to Boston with my family after graduating from the University of South Florida. 
 			I am currently working in IT at the Harvard School of Public Health, where I get to build AV racks and fix broken equipment, computers, and dreams. 
 			In my free time I enjoy running, wandering in the hilarity of the internet, and generally fixing/building/tweaking/keeping-myself-busy-ing. 
 			I am taking this Dynamic Web Applications course because I enjoy learning new skills and I don't have a personal website yet (seriously, it's almost 2013).
